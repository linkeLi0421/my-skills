Summarize raw text into a structured Markdown note with YAML front matter and write it into the provided notes repo. Auto-detect Markdown documents and store the full document body instead of a summary (override with mode). Use deterministic heuristics (errors/warnings, file:line patterns, tags) and return JSON with status, path, title, tags, and summary.
